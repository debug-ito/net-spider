# net-spider

**This is still work in progress.**

net-spider is a graph database middleware to maintain a time-varying graph. It stores history of local findings, and creates a snapshot graph at a specific time in the past.

The architecture of net-spider is like:

    input
    (local findings)
      |
      |         output
      |         (snapshot graph)
      |            ^
      v            |
    +=================+
    |    net-spider   |
    +=================+
    +-----------------+
    |    Tinkerpop    |
    | Gremlin Server  |
    |                 |
    | (history graph) |
    +-----------------+

As input, net-spider takes local findings of the time-varying graph. A local finding is a local state of a node observed at a specific time.

All local findings are stored in the graph database with timestamps. So the database stores the history of the time-varying graph (history graph).

The history graph can be queried via net-spider. When queried, it traverses the history graph to build a graph that should be the state of the time-varying graph at the specific time in the past.

Maintaining the graph database is delegated to [Tinkerpop Gremlin Server](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/). You have to set up a server instance seprately.
